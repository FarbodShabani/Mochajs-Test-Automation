# Mochajs-Test-Automation
This framework gets a little bit tricky when you want to work with promises and use the then method. I strongly suggest that in order to ditch the done method from the Mochajs framework and all the complexity that comes with it, use async and await keywords and try catch methods to find there is something wrong with your code.
